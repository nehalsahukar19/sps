  <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: cursive;">TOPIC CHOSEN</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: large;">
        <li>The possible topics which we preffered before finalizing this project are 
            <ul>
                <li> Smart River cleaning</li>
                <li> Pg Management System</li>
                <li> Smart Parking System</li>
            </ul><br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Many people around us were facing the problem of parking their vehicle.
            People were wasting lot of time for searching appropriate spaces to park their vehicles,lot of fuel was getting wasted.
            To provide the solution for that problem we finalized this website.Therefore we finalized a project named "SMART PARKING SYSTEM".</li><br><br>
        <li><ul>
            <li>Smart River cleaning : We have dropped this website because of lack of volunteers in this critical situation.So we rejected doing this project.</li>
            <li>Pg Management System : Due to this pandemic situation most of the pg's nearby collages are getting closed.So we rejected doing this project.</li>
        </ul></li>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: cursive;">WEBSITE DESIGN</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: large;"><li>Firstly we thought of designing website for all the different theatres in Bangalore and we also thought of adding timings
        (specific time for which the user wants to park his vehicle).</li>
        <li>Many people found it easy to park their vehicle directly without using our website for few specific theatres.
            We couldn't add cuurent timings because we didn't know at what time users leave particular slot.</li>
        <li>More people can be benefited through our website in finding empty parking space for a particular theatre.</li>
        <li>This website is applicable for a particular theatre.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr style="background: black; padding: 2px;">
    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: cursive;">FEATURES IMPLEMENTED</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: large;">
       <ul> <li><b>Saves Time :</b> The biggest benefit of finding a car parking space in advance is that it 
            saves you a lot of time. You don’t have to go round in circles trying to look 
            for an appropriate place to keep your car. Just book a parking space with this
             website and get going about your business.</li>
        <li><b>Safety : </b>In case you park at a non-designated spot, you stand a chance
            of your car getting towed or you being fined for incorrect parking.
             However, with this website, you can leave your vehicle at a parking lot,worry-free!</li>
        <li><b>Smart Parking : </b>With everything going digital in this technology-driven world, why leave parking spaces
            behind? You can find a car parking area near the place you’re visiting anywhere in
             India with just a few simple clicks.</li> 
        </ul>     
        <li>we thought of adding timings(specific time for which the user wants to park his vehicle).
            We couldn't add cuurent timings because we didn't know at what time users leave particular slot.So we didn't add these feature. </li>           
    </ul>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: cursive;">PROBLEMS FACED</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: large;">
        <li>Problem faced by us while designing this wesite is in slots page,we thought of giving blue colour as soon as the user book a slot, an red colour as soon as the user clicks the start ,
            but we couldn't do it because as soon as the other user opens this website , he still finds it as green.
        </li>
        <li>We used few javascript functions to overcome these problems.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr style="background: black; padding: 2px;">
    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: cursive;">FUTURE SCOPE</h1>
    <ul style="font-size: large;">
        <li>We will add directions for each slot in future.We will try to create this website for all the theatres in Bangalore.</li>
        <li>We will add Google maps to our wesite so that as soon as the user searches an empty parking
             slot he should get all the information regarding the slots present there. </li>
        <li>We wanted to design this website using sensors but due to lack of resources we couldn't make it. </li>          
    </ul>
